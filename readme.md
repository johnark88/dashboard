# This Repo

This repo uses Parcel, ESLint and Prettier.

- Prettier for formatting
- ESLint to make sure I don't brek anything
- Parcel to package it all up

I chose TailwindCSS for CSS. Easy to read and implement.

## Development

- Get the Dev server up and running

```bash
yarn dev
```

- Run linter

```base
yarn lint
```

- Run formater (This may happen on save depending on your
  VSCode setup)

```bash
yarn format
```

- Build it

```bash
yarn build
```

## About

Just picked up some new things about React. Decided I would start building my own dashboard to get more experiance with hooks and state.

Components added:

- weather - https://www.weatherbit.io/api/weather-current
  - air quality
- password generator

Components for later:

- stock market overall
- spcific stock tracker
- todo list
- time tracker - work hours - export hours as well
- job finder tracking
- clocks - my timezone / mpls/ others.
